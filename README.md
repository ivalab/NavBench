# NavBench

The purpose of NavBench is to enable others to reproduce the resutls found in our published works.

To run the experiments found in our ICRA 2020 submission _egoTEB: Ego-centric, Perception Space Navigation Using Timed-Elastic-Bands_, see the instructions located in ``ICRA2020/readme.md``.
